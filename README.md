# Elemental-Spheres-Inferno-and-Frost

In the context of a game jam organized by a student from 42 Le Havre for fellow students, my partner and I collaborated to create a game that adhered to the theme 'opposites.'
We accomplished this within a week, utilizing Unity. As complete beginners in C# and Unity, we took this opportunity to learn and apply these tools for our project.
All assets were created by us during the development process.

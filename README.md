# Elemental-Sphere-Inferno-and-Frost

### What is it ?
In the context of a [GameJam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam) organized by a student from 42 Le Havre for fellow students, [@Lapinew](https://github.com/Lapinew) and [@KoganeShiro](https://github.com/KoganeShiro) collaborated to create a game that adhered to the theme 'opposites.'


We accomplished this within a week, utilizing Unity.

As complete beginners in C# and Unity, we took this opportunity to learn and practice game developpement for our project.

Most of the script are made by [@Lapinew](https://github.com/Lapinew)
and all the assets were created by [@KoganeShiro](https://github.com/KoganeShiro) during the development process.

### The Game
The normal mode was originally a story mode but we didn't manage to do it so on the menu you will only be able do the infinite mode which is an endless runner or side-scrolling.

The goal is to survive with the best time, which is the longest time possible

### What now ?
As we liked our idea, we decided to continue the project implementing things we didn't get to implement and add even more to make a real game that could be played.

### Quick Start

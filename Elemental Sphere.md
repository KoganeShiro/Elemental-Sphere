# Normal Mode
## Stuff to consider
- fusion of the elements
- opening and ending cinematic
- How to get through the story without proper dialogue


## Story
Tuto, where the MC is ultra powerful
cinematic sequence, the main character engages in a fierce battle against the boss.
The boss attempts to absorb the protagonist, but the attempt fails, resulting in the boss weakening.
Both the main character and the boss now exhibit signs of being fragmented across different universes or worlds.

As the game concludes, a scene unfolds where the shadow representing the boss gradually departs, allowing light to return to the environment.

## Characters
Elements = fire, water, ice, magma, earth, wind, light, shadow, plant, metal, poison, health
#### feu-glace

#### lumiere-tenebre

#### eau-terre

#### poison-soin

#### terre-air=vent


### Enemy
Maybe have some kind of curse
Wants the power of the mc
Let them restore his power
At the end, they are absorb into the mc and heals


# Infinite Mode
a mode where the mc need to go as far as possible in the game.
A leader-board will be here to know the better score
As the time goes, the speed and the difficulty will also increase
Make the screen rotate
Put some orbs that will change the mc to different universe
